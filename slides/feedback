- traceroute issue on SK dataset:
  * either update mtr to remove averaging, Sam will deploy it in UK probes (or)
  * purge out unnecessary scamper features to make scamper small in size.

- Sam will give us as much UK dataset as we want.

- Getting US SK dataset is an issue because the FCC wants a US institute to
  participate in the research. Perhaps we can collaborate with Nick Feamster.

- Andrea (BT) says jitter is due to congestion in the last-mile in cable
  networks. It would be nice to show analysis from multiple probes.

- Trevor (BT) says you may not see correlation of depth level changes against
  packet loss measurements. DLM probably uses multiple line characteristics to
  tweak depth levels. Phil (BT) wants to know whether depth levels also
  decrease? Generally it would nice to show analysis from multiple probes.

- Phil (BT) finds it surprising that there are any diurnal patterns in
  last-mile. Sam (SamKnows) says probably it's just cross-traffic. Trevor (BT)
  says it's just private network devices screwing up results.

- Andrea (BT) wanted to see comparison of SK and RIPE atlas last-mile latency
  CDFs. For instance, comparing DSL (UK) last-mile latencies with DSL (US)
  latencies.

- Andrea (BT) says US uses different broadband products lines when compared to
  UK providers. For instance, a US broadband package of 8Mbps guarantees
  consistent 8Mbps throghput, and perhaps they don't need interleaving. While
  in UK they provide a package tier of upto 8Mbps.

- Marcelo (UC3M) wants to know why CPEs delay traceroute responses.

Discussion with Andrea (BT) and Trevor (BT):


- Andrea says DLM monitors mean time between errors (MTBE) to tweak depth
  levels and SNR

- MTBE and SNR parameters are set inside the DSL modem. Perhaps we can use
  UPnP requests to get these parameters. However, BTHomehub devices don't have
  UPnP enabled.

- Andrea says VirginMedia modems use DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem technology. He was
  talking about channel bonding, but I didn't undertand that part.

- Andrea says cable networks are good at acheiving higher sync speeds. He also
  says they use higher freqency on the last-mile.

- Andrea says it's interesting to look at jitter in cable networks and compare
  it with how DSL networks behave. He suggests to use very high frequency ping
  tests (every 1 sec) to the last mile. Trevor says it's better to use a packet
  dispersion test on SK probes. We need to read about this technique.
