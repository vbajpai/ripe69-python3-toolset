In this talk, we present a set of tools that we find useful for
measurement research and would like to share them with the larger RIPE
community.  Given the nature of the talk, we will make a live demo
presentation using ipython notebook, instead of using slides. These 
slides are only meant to give an overview of what we want to cover in the talk.
